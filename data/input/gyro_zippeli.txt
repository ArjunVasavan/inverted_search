**Gyro Zeppeli** (born Julius Caesar Zeppeli) is the co-protagonist of *Part 7: Steel Ball Run*. He is a master of the **Spin**, a mystical family technique involving the rotation of specialized **Steel Balls** to achieve various supernatural effects.

### Background and Motivation

Gyro is a former executioner and magistrate from the **Kingdom of Naples**. He travels to America to enter the Steel Ball Run—a cross-country horse race—for a deeply personal reason:

* **The Goal:** He seeks to win the race to secure royal amnesty for **Marco**, a young boy he believes was wrongfully sentenced to death.
* **The Conflict:** His participation is an act of defiance against his father, **Gregorio Zeppeli**, who believes an executioner should remain a "surgical instrument" devoid of personal emotion or doubt.

### Abilities: The Spin and Stands

Unlike previous "JoJos" who used Hamon or traditional Stands, Gyro relies on the **Spin**, which channels rotational energy through his Steel Balls.

* **Versatility:** He can use the Spin to manipulate muscles, deflect bullets, create mirages, or even perform medical procedures.
* **Scan:** After obtaining the "Right Eye" of the Holy Corpse, Gyro briefly manifests a Stand ability called **Scan**, which places eyes on his Steel Balls, granting him X-ray vision and enhanced precision.
* **Ball Breaker:** His ultimate ability, achieved through the "Super Spin" (utilizing the Golden Rectangle and his horse's power), creates the Stand **Ball Breaker**. This power can bypass dimensional barriers and induce rapid aging in anything it touches.

### Personality and Legacy

Gyro is known for his flamboyant and cocky attitude, often punctuated by his gold teeth (which have "GO! GO! ZEPPELI" engraved on them) and his unique laugh ("Nyo-ho!").

* **Mentor Role:** He serves as a mentor to **Johnny Joestar**, teaching him the "Five Lessons" of the Spin and helping him regain his ability to walk.
* **The "Zeppeli Curse":** True to his lineage, Gyro eventually sacrifices himself during the final battle against President **Funny Valentine**, passing on the final lesson of the Spin to Johnny so he can finish the fight.
